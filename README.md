# blog-engine

A simple blog engine on Django. 
Allows to post short updates with a single photo. 
Contains 3 page templates: home, single post, inner pages (goes as part of a separate app)
Comments engine: Disqus (but has a glitch identifying pages, so the comments are shown on all post pages as it would be the same comments thread).
